## Usage

See the [examples](examples) directory for how to use the `clash-netstack` library.

## Disclaimer

Heavily based on [netstack-smoltcp](https://github.com/automesh-network/netstack-smoltcp) with simplified API and some modifications to fit the `clash-rs` ecosystem.

This library is not intended for production use and is provided as-is. Use at your own risk
